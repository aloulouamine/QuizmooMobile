Android Mobile Application for Quizmoo Survey

In order to offer more flexibility of using the Quizmoo survey platform, Disycs decided to 

develop an Android mobile application based on REST3 architecture, for that I’m charged 

to develop the software that allows Android Quizmoo users to:

 Login and manage session via an access token.

 Access and preview all user’s surveys made on www.quizmoo.com, sorted by 

category and state.

 Send answers for surveys.

 Pin surveys for offline consulting.

 Share surveys in social and professional networks.

The application should handle an offline mode to answers surveys out of internet 

connection, all responses will be synchronized with server when internet connection is 

available.

The application should be adapted to various screen sizes, and work for both android 

mobile and tablet devices.

The Quizmoo developers’ team has already prepared an API to expose the website 

database information. I will detail all API resources in the contract in the next chapter 

before defining the REST architecture and Quizmoo survey platform.
